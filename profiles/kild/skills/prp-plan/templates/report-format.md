# Plan Created — User Report Format

> **Kild lane:** you are running inside a kild room, in a workspace (worktree + branch) the kild engine assigned. The driver owns isolation and publishing — SKIP any step below that creates or switches branches or worktrees, pulls or rebases the base branch, pushes, opens PRs, or moves/archives plan artifacts, and never run `gh pr checkout`. Your job ends at implement → validate → commit in the current workspace, reporting evidence. Where a step spawns subagents, do that analysis inline — or ask the room's orchestrator to invite a helper agent.

**MANDATORY**: after saving the plan file, display this report to the user in exactly this structure, filling every `{placeholder}` and dropping the `{If ...}` blocks that do not apply.

```markdown
## Plan Created

**File**: `{expanded absolute path to $PRP_DIR/plans/{feature-name}.plan.md}`

{If from PRD:}
**Source PRD**: `{prd-file-path}`
**Phase**: #{number} - {phase name}
**PRD Updated**: Status set to `in-progress`, plan linked

{If parallel phases available:}
**Parallel Opportunity**: Phase {X} can run concurrently in a separate worktree.
To start: `git worktree add -b phase-{X} ../project-phase-{X} && cd ../project-phase-{X} && the prp-plan skill {prd-path}`

**Summary**: {2-3 sentence feature overview}

**Complexity**: {LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH} - {brief rationale}

**Scope**:
- {N} files to CREATE
- {M} files to UPDATE
- {K} total tasks

**Key Patterns Discovered**:
- {Pattern 1 from codebase-explorer/analyst with file:line}
- {Pattern 2 from codebase-explorer/analyst with file:line}

**External Research**:
- {Key doc 1 with version}
- {Key doc 2 with version}

**UX Transformation**:
- BEFORE: {one-line current state}
- AFTER: {one-line new state}

**Risks**:
- {Primary risk}: {mitigation}

**Decisions & Questionables**:
- Confirmed at checkpoint: {N} — {one line per user-confirmed decision, or "none needed"}
- Planner defaults (disclosed): {N} — {one line each, or "none"}
- **`[DECISION REQUIRED]` (unresolved)**: {N} — {one line each, or "none"}

**Confidence Score**: {1-10}/10 for one-pass implementation success
- {Rationale for score}

{If NO [DECISION REQUIRED] items remain:}
**Next Step**: To execute, use the prp-implement skill {expanded absolute path to $PRP_DIR/plans/{feature-name}.plan.md}

{If any [DECISION REQUIRED] items remain:}
**Status**: ⚠️ DRAFT — {N} decision(s) required before implementation. Do NOT run `the prp-implement skill` yet.
**Next Step**: Decide the items above, then run `the prp-plan skill` to revise the plan with your answers (paste the plan path and your decisions).
