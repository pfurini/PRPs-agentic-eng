## What is PRP?

**Product Requirement Prompt (PRP)** = PRD + curated codebase intelligence + agent/runbook

The minimum viable packet an AI needs to ship production-ready code on the first pass.

A PRP supplies an AI coding agent with everything it needs to deliver a vertical slice of working software—no more, no less.

### How PRP Differs from Traditional PRD

A traditional PRD clarifies _what_ the product must do and _why_ customers need it, but deliberately avoids _how_ it will be built.

A PRP keeps the goal and justification sections of a PRD yet adds AI-critical layers:

- **Context**: Precise file paths, library versions, code snippet examples
- **Patterns**: Existing codebase conventions to follow
- **Validation**: Executable commands the AI can run to verify its work

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Install the plugin (recommended)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Wirasm/PRPs-agentic-eng
/plugin install prp-core@prp-marketplace
```

Every skill is then available across all your projects as `/prp-core:<name>`, updated centrally.

### Option 2: Copy the skills you want

```bash
# From your project root — copy individual skills (or the whole folder)
cp -r /path/to/PRPs-agentic-eng/.claude/skills/prp-plan .claude/skills/
```

### Option 3: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wirasm/PRPs-agentic-eng.git
cd PRPs-agentic-eng
```

## Skills

The `.claude/skills/` directory contains the core PRP workflow as Agent Skills — also distributed as the `prp-core` plugin (invoke as `/prp-core:<name>`):

### Core Workflow

| Command          | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/prp-prd`       | Interactive PRD generator with implementation phases     |
| `/prp-plan`      | Create implementation plan (from PRD or free-form input) |
| `/prp-implement` | Execute a plan through validated commit and PR            |
| `/prp-issue`     | Own an issue, plan, document, or idea through reviewed PR and green CI |
| `/prp-prd-update` | Maintain PRD phase status and delivery links             |

### Debug Workflow

| Command                  | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `/prp-debug`             | Diagnose a root cause and publish the evidence to the matching GitHub issue |

### Git & Review

| Command       | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `/prp-commit` | Smart commit with natural language file targeting |
| `/prp-pr`     | Create PR with template support                   |

| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/prp-loop` | Autonomous pipeline: plan → implement with PR → review (review→fix loops until clean) |
| `/prp-orchestrate` | Coordinate parallel workstreams running PRP skills in git worktrees, with review gates and merge sequencing |

### In Process

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `/prp-deliver` | Manual-only, top-level multi-context delivery experiment; excluded from distribution and orchestration |

### Research & Authoring

| Command                  | Description                                                              |

## PRP Loop (Autonomous Execution)

`/prp-loop` drives the full pipeline (`plan → implement with commit and PR → review`) headlessly, running one `claude -p` session per stage and looping `review → fix` until the PR review comes back clean. Progress is tracked in the project's PRP store at `~/.prp/<project-key>/state/prp-loop.state.json`.

### How It Works

```
/prp-loop "add user authentication with JWT"
```

1. **plan** — writes `~/.prp/<project-key>/plans/<feature>.plan.md`
2. **implement** — executes and validates the plan, commits the work, and opens the PR
3. **pr compatibility** — opens the PR only if an older implementation run did not
4. **review** — publishes the complete canonical review report to the PR
5. **cycle** — if fixes are needed, the full report feeds a correction pass → push → re-review, until ready or `--max-cycles` is reached

### Usage

```bash
# Run the full pipeline from a feature description
/prp-loop "add user authentication with JWT"

# Run through implementation and PR, then stop before review
/prp-loop "add user authentication with JWT" --until implement

# Resume a halted or in-progress loop
/prp-loop --resume
```

### Tips

- `--until <stage>` (`plan` | `implement` | `pr` | `review` | `fix`) halts once that stage completes; `--until implement` stops after the implementation is green, committed, and opened as a PR
- Defaults: `--max-cycles 3`, `--max-implement-iterations 10`; base branch is auto-detected
- Pass `--validate "<cmd>"` to give the loop an authoritative green check (exit 0 = pass)
- Works best with plans that have clear, testable validation commands
- State is tracked in `~/.prp/<project-key>/state/prp-loop.state.json`; inspect or resume from there

## Workflow Overview

### Large Features: PRD → Plan → Implement

```
/prp-prd "user authentication system"
    ↓
Creates PRD with Implementation Phases table
    ↓
/prp-plan ~/.prp/<project-key>/prds/user-auth.prd.md
    ↓
Auto-selects next pending phase, creates plan
    ↓
/prp-implement ~/.prp/<project-key>/plans/user-auth-phase-1.plan.md
    ↓
Implements and validates, then commits and opens a PR
    ↓
Links the plan, report, and PR back to the source PRD
    ↓
/prp-review
```

### Medium Features: Direct to Plan

```
/prp-plan "add pagination to the API"
    ↓
Creates implementation plan from description
    ↓
/prp-implement ~/.prp/<project-key>/plans/add-pagination.plan.md
```

### Any Work: Input to Reviewed PR and Green CI

```
/prp-issue 123
    ↓
Creates or resolves the plan, implements it, commits, and opens the PR
    ↓
Publishes the complete agent review on the PR
    ↓
Fixes or disproves review findings, re-reviews, and waits for green CI
```

## Artifacts Structure

Artifacts and runtime state are stored outside the repository in a per-project directory:

```
~/.prp/<project-key>/
├── project.json       # Canonical project path and name
├── prds/              # Product requirement documents
├── plans/             # Implementation plans
├── research/          # Codebase research
├── research-plans/    # Multi-agent research plans
├── reports/           # Implementation reports
├── reviews/           # Human-readable PR reviews
├── debug/             # Root-cause analysis reports
├── orchestration/     # Parallel-workstream run files
└── state/             # Loop state, logs, and hook sentinels
```

The project key is derived from the canonical main-checkout path, so all linked worktrees share the same store. Set `PRP_HOME` to override the default `~/.prp` root.

## PRD Phases

PRDs include an Implementation Phases table for tracking progress:

```markdown
| #   | Phase | Description | Status      | Parallel | Depends | Plan   | Report | PR     |
| --- | ----- | ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | Auth  | User login  | complete    | -        | -       | [link] | [link] | [link] |
| 2   | API   | Endpoints   | in-progress | -        | 1       | [link] | [link] | [link] |
| 3   | UI    | Frontend    | pending     | with 4   | 2       | -      | -      | -      |
| 4   | Tests | Test suite  | pending     | with 3   | 2       | -      | -      | -      |
```

- **Status**: `pending` → `in-progress` → `complete`
- **Parallel**: Phases that can run concurrently (in separate worktrees)
- **Depends**: Phases that must complete first

---

## PRP Best Practices

1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Bounded Scope**: Each plan should be completable by an AI in one loop

## Parallel Development with Worktrees

When PRD phases can run in parallel:

```bash
# Phase 3 and 4 can run concurrently
git worktree add -b phase-3-ui ../project-phase-3
git worktree add -b phase-4-tests ../project-phase-4

# Run Claude in each
cd ../project-phase-3 && claude
cd ../project-phase-4 && claude
```

## Resources

### Legacy Commands, Templates & Docs

The previous slash-command generation is preserved in `old-prp-commands/` for reference only. That includes its PRP templates (`old-prp-commands/PRPs/templates/` — `prp_base.md`, `prp_story_task.md`, `prp_planning.md`) and curated AI documentation (`old-prp-commands/PRPs/ai_docs/`). The current skills carry their templates inline or in their own `templates/` directories.
